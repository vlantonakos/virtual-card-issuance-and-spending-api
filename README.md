# Virtual Card Issuance and Spending API

## üíº Project Overview

This project implements the backend for a **Virtual Card Platform** where customers can create virtual cards, top them up, and spend from them. The platform guarantees that overspending is **never allowed**, even under concurrent usage, ensuring **transactional integrity and data consistency**.

---

## ‚úÖ Core Features

### Key Business Rules Implemented
- **Atomic Card Operations:** Card balance can never go below zero.
- **No Double-Spend:** Optimistic locking (@Version) on card updates prevents race conditions.
- **Block/Unblock:** Cards can be blocked and re-activated; blocked cards cannot be used for spending.
- **Rate Limiting:** Maximum 5 spend operations per card per minute.
- **Transaction History:** List and paginate all card transactions.
- **Robust Validation:** No spending on non-existent or blocked cards; strong input validation.
- **Consistent Error Handling:** Global exception handler maps business and concurrency errors to clear HTTP responses.

## üîå API Endpoints

- `POST /cards`  
  Creates a new virtual card with initial balance.

- `POST /cards/{id}/spend`  
  Spend an amount from the card.
  - Returns **400 Bad Request** if balance is insufficient, card is blocked/non-existent, or rate limit exceeded.

- `POST /cards/{id}/topup`  
  Add funds to an existing card.

- `GET /cards/{id}`  
  Retrieve card details including current balance and status.

- `GET /cards/{id}/transactions`  
  Returns transaction history with pagination support (page number and size query parameters).

- `GET /cards/{id}/balance`  
  Returns current balance and card status.

- `GET /cards/{id}/status`  
  Returns card status and cardholder information.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack and Implementation

- **Spring Boot:** (Java 11), Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, Bean Validation
- **Optimistic Locking:** JPA @Version for safe, concurrent updates
- **Database:**
  - `local` profile: Oracle DB
  - `dev` profile: H2 in-memory DB for fast development/testing.
- **Liquibase:** Schema migrations (CARD_PLATFORM schema)
- **Logging:** Console and file output with timestamped pattern (application.yml)
- **Profiles:** Easily switch between Oracle and H2 via spring.profiles.active
- **Global Exception Handler:** Unified error responses, including 409 Conflict for concurrency issues

---

## üß† Design Decisions

- **Layered Architecture:** Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository; DTOs and domain models for separation of concerns.

- **Domain-Driven:** Core business logic (locking, rate limiting, pagination) lives in the domain/service layer.

- **Transactional Safety:** All state-changing operations use @Transactional.

- **Integration Testing:** Includes concurrent spend simulation to guarantee race condition safety and correct error handling.

---

## üöÄ How to Use

- **Activate profiles**:
  - `local` (Oracle DB): `-Dspring.profiles.active=local`
  - `dev` (H2 DB): `-Dspring.profiles.active=dev`

## Prerequisites

- Java 11 (OpenJDK 11.0.28)
- Maven 3.8.7
- Tested on Linux (WSL2)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs Made Due to Time Constraints

### 1. Automated Deployment (Nx + Ansible)
- **Planned:** Use Nx with `project.json` targets to streamline backend builds and define clear execution flows.
- **Planned:** Automate infrastructure setup and deployment using Ansible playbooks for consistent environments.
- **Trade-off:** This was deprioritized to focus on feature completeness, transactional safety, and concurrency correctness.

---

## üöÄ Potential Improvements

- **OpenAPI (Swagger) Integration:**  
  Add automatic API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI for clearer and interactive API docs.

- **Dedicated Validation Services:**  
  Introduce separate validation services such as `CardValidationService` and `TransactionValidationService` that encapsulate business rules and validations. These services would be called from the **domain service layer (`CardDomainService`)** during operations like card creation, spending, and top-ups to ensure clean separation of concerns and maintainability.

## üìö Learning Strategy for New Libraries and Tools

During the development of this project, I learned important concepts and tools related to handling concurrency and ensuring data consistency.

### Optimistic Locking with `@Version`

At first, I explored **pessimistic locking** by using Spring Data JPA‚Äôs `@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)` annotation to lock card records during updates. However, I discovered that using the `@Version` annotation for **optimistic locking** is a more efficient way to handle concurrent updates. This approach allows multiple transactions to proceed without locking, but automatically detects conflicting updates by version checking, throwing an `OptimisticLockException` when conflicts occur.

### Integration Testing with Concurrency Tools

I also had to adopt new libraries and Java concurrency tools to properly test concurrent behavior in integration tests. Specifically, I used:

- `ExecutorService` to manage multiple threads.
- `CountDownLatch` to coordinate simultaneous execution of threads.
- `Future` to capture the results of asynchronous tasks.

These tools were essential to simulate concurrent spend requests on the same card and verify that optimistic locking worked as expected, by ensuring one transaction succeeds while the other fails with a conflict (HTTP 409).

This experience enhanced my ability to write robust integration tests for concurrent scenarios, which was new territory for me.
